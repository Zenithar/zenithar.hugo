Oui ça fait un an, aujourd'hui qu'on est ensemble, déjà... ça passe trop vite ^^ (En même temps, mieux vaut ça que conter les heures ...). Ah lala ! ça fait bizarre d'entendre des personnes de votre famille, dire fait la bise à ta femme de ma part ^^. C'est rigolo, mais j'aime ça !

Je t'aime ma chérie. Surprise ...

Well I heard there was a secret chord
    
    That David played, and it pleased the Lord But you don't really care for music, do ya? Well it goes like this The fourth, the fifth The minor fall and the major lift The baffled king composing Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Well Your faith was strong but you needed proof You saw her bathing on the roof Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you she tied you to her kitchen chair She broke your throne and she cut your hair And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Well baby I've been here before I’ve seen this room and I've walked this floor I used to live alone before I knew ya I've seen your flag on the marble arch Love is not a victory march It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Well there was a time when you let me know What's really going on below But now you never show that to me do you? And remember when I moved in you? And the holy dove was moving too And every breath we drew was Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Well maybe there's a God above But all I've ever learned from love Was how to shoot somebody who'd OUT DREW YA And it's not a cry that you hear at night It's not somebody who's seen the light It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah

Bisous ma chérie que j'aime plus que tout.
